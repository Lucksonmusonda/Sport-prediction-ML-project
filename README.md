Sport Prediction using Machine Learning


 Developed a machine learning model to predict an individual’s suitability for playing specific sports based on height, age, and sex.  Utilized Python and various AI/ML libraries for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.  Implemented linear regression, classification algorithms (including decision trees), and logistic regression
 Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data distributions and correlations.  Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Collaborated with a cross-functional team to enhance the model’s accuracy and generalization.  Achievements:
 Successfully improved the accuracy of sport player predictions by 15% through feature engineering and algorithm
selection.
